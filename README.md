# WASM Bird

A flappy bird inspired game created using Golang, WASM, and TypeScript.

## Tools

-   Golang
-   NodeJS + TypeScript
-   WASM
-   Docker

## Todo

-   MAYBE add webpack for the TS
- WebGL with WASM might be interesting (my own game engine + visualizing algorithms)
- Cap FPS at 60 (use a setTimeout before rendering the next frame with 1000 / 60 as timeout)
