# WASM-Bird

A flappy bird game created using Golang, WASM, and TypeScript.

## Tools

-   Golang
-   NodeJS + TypeScript
-   WASM
-   Docker

## Todo

-   Rewrite in Go
-   Add to docker and deploy (docker compose ?)
-   MAYBE add webpack for the TS
- WebGL with WASM might be interesting (my own game engine + visualizing apps)
